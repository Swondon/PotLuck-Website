  At Potluck Markets, we believe the future of prediction is social. 
  It looks less like a trading floor and more like a group chat that is energized, opinionated, transparent, and powered by people rather than platforms. 
  This post outlines the vision behind Potluck and the direction we are building toward.
</p>

<p>
  The internet has made it easy to share takes, but nearly impossible to measure conviction. 
  Social feeds are full of opinions with no stakes, no accountability, and no meaningful signal. 
  Potluck flips that dynamic by introducing lightweight social contracting that is fun, consensual, and resolved by the group rather than a distant house. 
  We are creating a space where people can express what they believe and stand behind it with community decision making instead of financial speculation.
</p>

<p>
  Our vision starts with trust. On Potluck, your market is not a global exchange filled with anonymous traders. It is your circle. 
  The people whose judgment you know, whose humor you understand, and whose bets you are willing to negotiate over. 
  That shift from trading with strangers to predicting with people you know turns prediction into a social experience instead of a financial transaction.
</p>

<p>
  Long term, we see Potluck becoming a universal layer for friendly competition, shared challenges, and collective decision making. 
  Who is showing up to the game? Will it rain on Saturday? Can your roommate finish their project by midnight? 
  These questions are not meant for Wall Street. They are meant for the people you talk to every day. 
  Potluck brings that energy online and adds structure, incentives, and a smooth experience so those moments feel fun instead of chaotic.
</p>

<p>
  As we grow, the product will expand from simple wagers to richer experiences such as collaborative predictions, group based quests, private circles, and community curated outcomes. 
  But the core will stay the same. Prediction should be a social act. 
  Not gambling. Not speculation. Just people sharing what they think will happen next and having fun while doing it.
</p>

<p>
  We are early in this journey. The product is evolving quickly. The vision is steady. We want a world where predictions bring people closer and where the internet feels less performative and more participatory. 
  Potluck Markets is not just a place to be right or wrong. It is a place to play, challenge, collaborate, and celebrate the everyday bets that make life more interesting.
</p>

<p>
  We are excited for what is ahead and we cannot wait to build this with you.
</p>

<p>
  Happy Monday,
</p>
